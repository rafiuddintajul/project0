      <h1 id="Intro">Skateboard</h1>
      <p>Skateboard is a wonderful sport and it is my favorite sport. It is in fact one of a difficult sports to play. It requires years and years of training to master even one trick.
        A lot of determination is also part of keys to success in this sport. Imagine keep falling and falling and hurts your own body just to master a trick. For some skaters, learning a trick
        is not enough. They have a dream to conquer obstacle. This makes this sport risk even greater. I am not talking about a 7 inch high ledge where 10 years old can do nosetail
        or even a ramp as high as your ankle. I am talking about something like 25 stairs, loop ramp or even 60 foot megaramp. But some skater they are doing very well with trick with skateboard
        alone and does not even need a dangerous obstacle.</p>

      <h2 id="History" class="history">History</h2>
      <h3 id="1940s" class = "years">1940s–1960s</h3>
      <p> Modern skateboard originaly designed when surfer want to do something on the ground. The first skateboards started with wooden boxes, or boards, with roller skate wheels attached to the bottom.
          Then "sidewalk surfing" was invented. During this era skaters emulated surfing style and maneuvers, and performed barefoot</p>
      <p> By 1960s skateboard was design to resembled small surfboard. Two original disciplines were introduced to be part of competition during this time, which is flatland freestyle and slalom
          downhill racing. <a href="#top-nav">Back Top</a></p>


      <h3 id="1970s" class = "years">1970s</h3>
      <p> Early 1970s, new material for wheel was created. Instead of metal or "clay" wheel, wheel are now made of polyurethane and it tremendously improve skater experience. Many other company
          started to manufacture specifically designed trucks and deck, which is the board, become wider to improve in maneuvering. </p>
      <p> Soon afterwards, skateboarding contests use a profesional tier system which feature freestyle and slalom. Prominent name like Tony Alva, Stacy Peralta etc manged to bring a new progressive
          style of skateboarding. Due to the up and down popularity of skateboarding very few skateparks are open to the public. In fact, only two were recorded during early 1976.
          Olie was believe to be invented during time by Alan Gelfand which was known as no-hands aerial back then. <a href="#top-nav">Back Top</a></p>

      <h3 id="1980s" class = "years">1980s</h3>
      <p> During this era, most skateboard companies focus on vert ramp skateboarding initially. Street skating gained it popularity due to the fact that many skater has no vert ramp of
          their own, nor have the access to nearby ramp. Thus, the Godfather of Street Skateboarding is born, who is know as Rodney Mullen. He invented a lot of tricks and become a major influence
          of freestyle skateboarding in mid 1980s.</p>
      <p> Since only few skateparks were available this time, lot of skatboarder would love to perform their trick in public area such as mall and other public and private property. People
          started to ban skateboarding on their properties. <a href="#top-nav">Back Top</a></p>


      <h3 id="1990s" class = "years">1990s</h3>
      <p> This is the age where street skateboarding is dominating. During this time most boards are about 7 1⁄4 to 8 inches (180 to 200 mm) wide and 30 to 32 inches (760 to 810 mm) long.
          The wheels are made of an extremely hard polyurethane, with hardness (durometer) approximately 99A. <a href="#top-nav">Back Top</a></p>


      <h3 id="2000" class = "years">2000-present</h3>
      <p> Young people started to love skateboarding. New generation of skateboarding was growing faster than before. Many cities started to recognize skateboard as a sport and started to build
          facilities. Many new skatepark were specifically designed for street skateboarding. There are also an increasingly in trend for skateboard alternate variant such as electric skateboards,
          longboards etc.<a href="#top-nav">Back Top</a></p>
